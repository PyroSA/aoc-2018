Advent of Code - 2018
---------------------

These are my attempts at solving these little daily puzzles from https://adventofcode.com/2018/
(Thanks Eric Wastl!)

I doubt I'll go for anything near optimal, but hopefully I get time to solve them all!
Depending on how complex the input gets, I'll try to have the input in the file itself.
